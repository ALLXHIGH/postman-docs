## Crafting Your Public Profile

Please refere to the doucmentation for [Public Profiles](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/postman-profile/)

## Organizing Public Workspaces

Workspaces are a grouping of schemas, collections, variables, tests, and more that describe and interact with your APIs. Collections are usually where developers are first to be drawn to, to interact with you API.

### Creating Collection Folders

Collections can divide requests into folders by domain, team, service, or use case.

## Writing Detailed Documentation

Write detailed [documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/) for each collection and request.
Standardize the language around your workspace and its APIs will create a fluid experience for a developer learning how to interact with your systems.Use meaningful names for requests , collections, and folders

Name requests by the actions developers expect. Reuse variables through out your collection and keep their names clear and concise to the values they hold.

Check how good your documentation is using the [Documentation Linter](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/published-postman-templates/documentation/1559645-4b520b0d-cf53-41be-8d24-0e0136416091)

When properly defined, Postman collections provide a rich way to define shareable, portable, and embeddable documentation for APIs, moving API documentation out of the portal and making it available anywhere, designed to keep up with the pace of change across enterprise operations.

### Define and Describe Variables

Next to every variable you can write documentation around what the expected value of this variable is and/or examples of its values.
Variables can be defined independently and stored within environments, but then applied across collections, providing variables that can be used for authentication, pagination, and other common aspects of working with APIs. Variables may define a state across multiple APIs and collections.

### Write Descriptions for Folders and Requests

Folders help logical seperate requests within a collection for organizing and sequencing API requests for browsing by humans, but also automating with a runner or as part of a CI/CD pipeline, helping organize reference API collections, choreograph automation, and orchestrations across many different APIs as part of a single collection.

At the Collection or folder-level would be a good place to mention how to sign up or get started with your API. Be sure to use keywords in all your documentation for good discoverability on the internet and on the Public API Network.

## Add Examples to Requests

Examples of the API request, responses, and messages used across API operations helps provide a versioned, evolvable, and reusable set of example and synthetic data that can make documentation richer and testing more relevant to actual business needs.

### Detail Authorization

Create documentation around how to authorize with your API. You can mention this in the documentation overview or in itâ€™s own folder if you have several different API request workflows or a more complicated authorization schema.

## Creating Multiple Environments for Different Use Cases

You can [create environments](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/#creating-environments) for different use cases and add them to your Public Workspace. This helps users understand what they need for what they want to use with your APIs.

## Protecting Sensitive Data

When creating and sharing environment variables make sure you leave examples of values in the Initial value which gets synced to the Public Workspace. Current value is where you can add values you are using and they do not sync to the workspace.

## Creating API Cookbooks

Create example workflows under a collection or a collection of folders for example use cases. Or for someone to fork and get started right away.

Examples of Cookbooks you can make are:

- Authentication and Authorization Cookbooks

- Integration Use Cases

- Automated Use Cases
