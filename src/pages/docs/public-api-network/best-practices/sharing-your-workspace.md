### Sharing and Watching Your Workspace

Being a part of the API Network means your searchable in the Postman app.
It also means being featured on our Explore page if your API is being watched or forked enough times.

Discovery means enabling API consumers to find exactly the right API they need for their application or integration.
It also means giving consumers everything they will need to onboard with an API. ng Consumers need to assess the overall quality and reliability of the API, then get to work integrating it into their use case, no matter what language they are using.

### Linking To A Workspace

Public Workspaces can be linked to by using the team name and workspace name in this format:

`postman.co/[team-name]/workspace/[workspace-name]/overview`

This will usually open up the workspace in the Postman Web App in the browser.

## Sharing Collections and Documentation

Cross-linking to your API’s documentation and to your Postman collection creates a fluid developer experience.
Use embeddable Postman’s [Run in Postman buttons](https://learning.postman.com/docs/publishing-your-api/run-in-postman/introduction-run-button/), and create links to your documentation within Postman’s documentation. that consumers can activate with one click.

### Adding a Hyperlink in Postman Documentation

Link back to your documentation using hyperlinks in your [documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/#adding-links).

## Workspace Metrics

### Watches

Keeping track of the watches on workspaces, APIs, and collections to understand who is tuned into what is happening. Use watches as a
metric for the number of consumers, contributors, and internal and external stakeholders who are tuned in.

### Forks

Making a linked copy of an API, or the mocks, documentation, tests, and other areas of the lifecycle defined as a collection to another workspace, allowing anyone to run on their own, make changes and enhancements, then if they desire, contribute back to the original and receive regular updates over time.
