Being a part of the API Network means your searchable in the Postman app.
It also means being featured on our Explore page if your API is being watched or forked enough times.

Discovery means enabling API consumers to find exactly the right API they need for their application or integration.
It also means giving consumers everything they will need to onboard with an API. ng Consumers need to assess the overall quality and reliability of the API, then get to work integrating it into their use case, no matter what language they are using.

## Linking to a public workspace

Public Workspaces can be linked to by using the team name and workspace name in this format:

`postman.co/[team-name]/workspace/[workspace-name]/overview`

This will usually open up the workspace in the Postman Web App in the browser.

## Creating links in your documentation

[Create links](/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/#adding-links) between your APIâ€™s documentation and your collection, enabling developers to quickly navigate your API. You can add a link from your documentation to your collection using a [Run in Postman button](/docs/publishing-your-api/run-in-postman/introduction-run-button/).

## Tracking public workspace metrics

You can use the number of watchers and forks in your public workspace to track its success.

### Watchers

Track the number of watchers on your workspace, APIs, and collections to understand who is interested in your APIs. You can use the numbers of watchers as a metric for the number of consumers, contributors, and internal and external stakeholders who are interested in your APIs.

### Forks

Making a linked copy of an API, or the mocks, documentation, tests, and other areas of the lifecycle defined as a collection to another workspace, allowing anyone to run on their own, make changes and enhancements, then if they desire, contribute back to the original and receive regular updates over time.
