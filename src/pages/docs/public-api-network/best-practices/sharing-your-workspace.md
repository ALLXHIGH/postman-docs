Being part of the [Public API Network](/docs/getting-started/exploring-public-api-network/) means your API is searchable in the Postman app. If consumers actively watch and fork your API, it'll be featured on Postman's [Explore](https://www.postman.com/explore) page.

## Linking to a public workspace

You can navigate to a public workspace from your browser using the following URL format:

```shell
https://www.postman.com/[team-name]/workspace/[workspace-name]/overview
```

To learn more about giving your workspace URL to Postman users, see [Sharing a public workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/public-workspaces/#sharing-a-public-workspace).

## Creating links in your documentation

[Create links](/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/#adding-links) between your APIâ€™s documentation and your collection, enabling developers to quickly navigate your API. You can add a link from your documentation to your collection using a [Run in Postman button](/docs/publishing-your-api/run-in-postman/introduction-run-button/).

## Tracking public workspace metrics

You can use the number of watchers and forks in your public workspace to track its success.

> For additional metrics, you can also view reports for [public workspaces](/docs/reports/all-workspaces-reports/#public-workspaces) and [public APIs](/docs/reports/all-apis-reports/#public-apis) in your [Postman reports dashboard](https://go.postman.co/reports/summary) ([Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing)).

### Watchers

Track the number of watchers on your [workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/#watching-a-workspace), [APIs](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/managing-apis/#watching-apis), and [collections](/docs/collections/using-collections/#watching-a-collection) to understand who is interested in your APIs. You can use the number of watchers as a metric for the number of consumers, contributors, and internal and external stakeholders who are interested in your APIs.

### Forks

Track the number of [forks](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-entities/) on your collections, environments, and flows to understand who is actively consuming and contributing to your APIs.

For more details about viewing the number of people who forked a Postman entity, see [Viewing fork information](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-entities/#viewing-fork-information).
