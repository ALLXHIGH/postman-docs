You can onboard your public API consumers quickly and efficiently by setting up guided API authentication in Postman. This feature enables you to communicate the steps users need to take to successfully make their request to your API, such as registering for a developer account or creating an app on your dashboard. When a user creates a request to your API, Postman will automatically recognize it requires authentication and prompt them with your provided steps to set up authorization.
