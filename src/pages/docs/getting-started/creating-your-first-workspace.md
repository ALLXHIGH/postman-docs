Postman workspaces allow you to organize and collaborate on API projects with your team. Within each workspace you can share [APIs](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/creating-an-api/), [collections](/docs/getting-started/creating-the-first-collection/), [environments](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/), and other components of your work in Postman.

When you first open Postman, you will be in your default personal workspace, but you can create more workspaces for your personal use and to collaborate with teammates. To create additional workspaces, you need to be signed into a [Postman account](/docs/getting-started/postman-account/).

## Accessing existing workspaces

To access your workspaces, select **Workspaces** in the upper left. You can search for existing workspaces using the search bar or select one from the dropdown list.

## Creating a new workspace

Select **Create Workspace** to add a new workspace.

Enter a **Name** and optional **Summary** for your workspace, then determine its visibility.

You can choose a **Team** workspace if you plan to invite collaborators, a **Personal** workspace, or a **Private** workspace which is only visible to the user who created it and team members who have been invited to join it.

Select **Create Workspace**.

Postman will switch to your new workspace when you create it. Move between workspaces at any time by selecting from the dropdown **Workspaces** list in the upper left.

## Next steps

After you create a new workspace, you can select **Invite** to [invite](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/#sharing-workspaces) people to join your new workspace.
