Postman workspaces allow you to organize and collaborate on API projects with your team. Within each workspace you can share [APIs](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/creating-an-api/), [collections](/docs/getting-started/creating-the-first-collection/), [environments](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/), and other components of your work in Postman.

When you first open Postman, you will be in your default personal workspace, but you can create more workspaces for your personal use and to collaborate with teammates. To create additional workspaces, you need to be signed into a [Postman account](/docs/getting-started/postman-account/).

## Creating a new workspace

1. Select **Workspaces** in the upper left. Select **Create Workspace** to add a new workspace.

    > You can also search for existing workspaces using the search bar or select one from the dropdown list.

1. Enter a **Name** and optional **Summary** for your workspace.
1. Choose the workspace's visibility:
    * A **Team** workspace allows you to invite collaborators.
    * A **Personal** workspace is only visible and accessible to you.
    * A **Private** workspace is only visible to you and to any team members you invite to join it.
1. Select **Create Workspace**.

Postman will switch to your new workspace when you create it. You can move between workspaces at any time by selecting from the dropdown **Workspaces** list in the upper left.

## Next steps

After you create a new workspace, you can select **Invite** to [invite](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/#sharing-workspaces) people to join your new workspace.
