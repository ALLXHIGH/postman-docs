Postbot is your AI assistant for API workflows in Postman. You can ask Postbot to help you debug and understand APIs, write tests, create Postman Flows, make sense of large data sets, and more.

To use Postbot, look for the Postbot icon <img alt="Postbot icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/icon-postbot-v10-16.jpg#icon" width="18px">. Select it and enter a plan text prompt, and Postbot will help you complete your work.

Here are the places in Postman where you can use Postbot:

* **Writing tests** - Postbot can add tests to your API requests based on your prompt. Use Postbot to add a new set of tests, visualize responses, save a field from a response, or fix your existing tests. For more information, see [using Postbot to write tests](/docs/writing-scripts/test-scripts#using-postbot-to-write-tests).
* **Writing FQL in Postman Flows** - _Flows Query Language_ (FQL) enables you to parse and transform JSON data to get the fields and structure you want. You can ask Postbot to generate FQL for you. Enter an idea for a query in simple text, and Postbot will suggest an FQL query for your. For more information, see [Using Postbot with FQL](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/introduction-to-fql/#using-postbot-with-fql)

We are excited about the longer-term potential of AI and the valuable role it can play. Stay tuned for more new Postbot updates as we continue to add more new features to automate how you work with APIs.
