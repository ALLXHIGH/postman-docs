The _Postman API Client_ is a space where you can work if you're using the Postman desktop app and not connected to Postman servers. When you aren't signed in or don't have a network connection, you can still use the offline API Client to send requests, including HTTP, WebSocket, gRPC, and GraphQL requests.

All of your work in the API Client is stored locally and isn't synced online with Postman. After working in the API Client, you can later move your open requests and history into a workspace once you sign in to Postman.

> **Can I still use the Scratch Pad?** New Postman users who download the Postman desktop app now use the Postman API Client instead of the Scratch Pad when not connected to Postman's servers. Postman users who have data on the Scratch Pad will continue to use the Scratch Pad when not connected to Postman's servers. Learn more about [using the Scratch Pad](/docs/getting-started/using-scratch-pad/).

## Accessing the API Client

When you open the Postman desktop app for the first time, if you choose not to sign up or sign in to Postman, you will enter the API Client. You'll also enter the API Client if you sign out of Postman or if you lose your network connection.

## API Client features

While you are in the API Client, you can:

* Create a new HTTP, WebSocket, gRPC, or GraphQL request
* Send a request
* View your history of your sent requests

## Leaving the API Client

1. Ensure you have a network connection to Postman, and [sign in to Postman](/docs/getting-started/postman-account/#signing-in-to-postman).
1. Switch to a workspace by selecting **Workspaces** from the header. For more information, see [Using and managing workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/).

## Migrating API Client data to a workspace

When [signing up for a Postman account](/docs/getting-started/postman-account/#signing-up-for-a-postman-account), your open requests and history are migrated to your default personal workspace.

When [signing in to Postman](/docs/getting-started/postman-account/#signing-in-to-postman), you can choose the workspace where you want to migrate your open requests and history.
