How to use the API Client

> **Can I still use the Scratch Pad?** New Postman users who download the Postman desktop app now use the Postman API Client instead of the Scratch Pad. Postman users who have data on the Scratch Pad will continue to use the Scratch Pad when offline or not signed in to Postman. Learn more about [using the Scratch Pad](/docs/getting-started/using-scratch-pad/).
