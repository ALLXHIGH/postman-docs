<!-- TODO: intro -->

After you create a Postman account, you can customize your Postman profile. Your Postman profile gives you a way to share important information about yourself with other Postman users.

Your profile includes:

* Links to relevant resources like your GitHub profile
* Links to any teams you are a part of
* An About Me section
* A Highlights section with pinned elements
* An Activity feed with a chronological list of your recent activity in the public API network

<!-- TODO: screenshot -->

## Making your profile public

By default, your Postman profile is visible to your Postman team. You can also choose to make your profile public to the Postman community. Having a public profile enables you to share important information about yourself and your work with other Postman users.

To turn your public profile on or off at any time in your [profile settings](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/):

1. Select your avatar in the Postman header > **Settings**.
1. Select **Profile** from the list of options.
1. Select **Make profile public**.
1. Select **Update Profile** to save your changes.

1. Select your avatar in the Postman header > **Settings**.
1. Select **Profile** from the list of options.
1. Edit the fields you want to update.
S. Select **Update Profile** to save changes.

## Adding an About Me section

Your **About Me** section contains information about, well, YOU! You can add information about your work, interests, and contributions&mdash;anything you want people looking at your profile to know. Update your **About Me** section at any time in your [profile settings](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/):

1. Select your avatar in the Postman header > **Settings**.

## Updating your About Me section

If you have already created an About Me section, you can edit it by selecting the edit icon <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/documentation-edit-icon-v8-10.jpg#icon" width="18px">. Make your changes, then select **Save**.

## Pinning elements to your Highlights

All elements must be available on the public API network???

if you don't choose any elements to pin to your profile, Postman will select the most popular elements (what criteria?) for this section.

To edit the elements in the Highlights section, select the edit icon <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/documentation-edit-icon-v8-10.jpg#icon" width="18px">. To remove elements, select the close icon <img alt="Close icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-close.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to the element name. To add an element to your Highlights section, select it from the list. Select **Save**.
