> Postman Free lets teams of up to three work together at no cost. To collaborate with more team members, features, and increased usage limits, see [Plans and Pricing](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).

Postman provides a variety of tools to enable and enhance collaboration within your team. You can ease the onboarding process by enabling [team discovery](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/enabling-team-discovery/), allowing users in your organization to request to join your Postman team. You can also create [team workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/collaborating-in-team-workspaces/), where team members can share their work and collaborate on API projects. Users can [discuss their work](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/discussing-your-work/) directly in Postman by commenting on collections and APIs, including on specific requests, versions, and inline on schemas and scripts.

To get the most out of Postman's collaboration features, [create](#creating-a-team) or [join](#joining-a-team) a team. You can be a member of multiple Postman teams, regardless of if they are Postman Free, Basic, Professional, or Enterprise.

> Note that if an Enterprise team within your organization implements [domain capture](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/configuring-domain-capture/), you won't be able to remain on or join extra Postman teams with your captured accounts.

## Creating a team

To create a Postman team:

1. Select your avatar in the upper-right corner > **Create a team**. If you're already a member of a Postman team, select **+ Create Team**
2. Select **Edit Team Profile**.
3. (Optional) Provide a team name, URL, and logo, and decide if you'd like to turn on [team discovery](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/enabling-team-discovery/).
4. Select **Continue**.
5. (Optional) Invite collaborators to your team via email or share an invite link.
6. Select **Continue** or **Maybe Later**.

[Postman Free](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) lets teams of up to three work together at no cost. If you'd like to collaborate with more team members, features, and increased usage limits, you can [upgrade](/docs/administration/billing/#changing-your-plan) to a Basic, Professional, or Enterprise plan. To do so, select **Upgrade** in the upper-right corner.

> For more information on setting up Postman within your organization, check out the [Onboarding checklist](/docs/administration/onboarding-checklist/).

## Joining a team

There are several ways you can join a Postman team:

* **Email invite** - Select **Join Team** in the email invite. Create a new Postman account or sign in to an existing one. Once you've signed in, you'll be redirected to your new team.
* **Invite link** - Open the link and select **Accept Invite**. Create a new Postman account or sign in to an existing one. Once you've signed in, you'll be redirected to your new team.
* **Team discovery** - When signed in to Postman, you can [find teams to join within your organization](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/enabling-team-discovery/#finding-teams-within-your-organization).

## Leaving a team

You can leave a Postman team by selecting your avatar in the top right, then **Settings**. Select **Teams** on the left.

Select **Leave Team** to the right of a team to leave it. If you're a member of an Enterprise team that has [SCIM configured](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/), you must contact a Team Admin to remove you from the team.

When you leave a team, you no longer have access to the team's workspaces, including personal workspaces, or any of the elements in them. You must reassign your personal workspaces to a remaining team member before leaving.

If you're the last member to leave a team, the team will be deleted. You will no longer have access to the team's workspaces, including personal workspaces, or any elements in them.

## Team usage limits

Your team's usage limits are based on your [plan type](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) and any [add-ons](/docs/administration/billing/#purchasing-add-ons) your team has purchased.

The Postman usage menu lets you review your team's limits for APIs, shared requests and history, mocks, monitors, and public documentation.

* **Free users** - Next to your avatar, select the menu to the right of **Upgrade**.
* **Paid users** - Next to your avatar, select **Team**.

For more details and to view your usage period, select **Resource Usage**.

Team members with the [Billing role](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) can [purchase extra blocks](/docs/administration/billing/#purchasing-add-ons) of monitoring requests, mock server calls, and custom domains in the [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing).
