> Postman Free lets teams of up to three to work together at no cost. To collaborate with more team members, features, and increased usage limits, see [Plans and Pricing](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).

Postman provides a variety of tools to enable and enhance collaboration within your team. You can ease the onboarding process by enabling [team discovery](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/enabling-team-discovery/), allowing users in your organization to request to join your Postman team. You can also create [team workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/collaborating-in-team-workspaces/), where team members can share their work and collaborate on API projects. Users can [discuss their work](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/discussing-your-work/) directly in Postman by commenting on collections and APIs, including on specific requests, versions, and inline on schemas and scripts.
