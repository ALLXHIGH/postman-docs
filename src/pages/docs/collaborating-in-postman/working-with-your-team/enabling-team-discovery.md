Team discovery encourages collaboration by easing the onboarding process for new team members. When team discovery is enabled, users who have a verified email address with your company's domain can request to join your Postman team.

## Enabling team discovery

To enable team discovery:

* Free users: Next to your avatar, select the menu to the right of **Upgrade**, then select **Manage Team**.
* Paid users: Next to your avatar, select **Team**, then select **Manage Team**.

On your Team Settings page, select **Team discovery** on the left, then select **Enable team discovery**. This will enable anyone from your domain to find and request to join your team.

> Team Admins will receive an email notification when team discovery is enabled.

You can optionally add a question for pending team members to answer when they request to join your team. Enter your question and select **Update Question**. Anyone who requests to join the team will be prompted with the question. If you don't specify a question, team members can still add a note when they request to join the team.

All [Team Admins](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) will receive a notification when someone makes a request to join your team, including their answer to any question you set, or an optional note.

## Finding teams within your organization

When you sign into Postman using a verified email address for your organization, you can find available teams to join by selecting your avatar > **Your Team**. Postman will also offer a list of available teams when you first sign into your Postman account with a verified address.

[![Choose Team](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/join-team-from-list.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/join-team-from-list.jpg)

Select a team from the list of the available teams within your organization. Answer the question set by the Team Admin, if there is one. You can also add an optional note. Select **Request to join**.

Team Admins will receive a notification when you ask to join the team. Once they approve your request, you'll be able to access the team and collaborate on API projects within it.
