Enabling team discovery

When you enable team discovery, users who have a verified email address with your company's domain can request to join pre-existing teams within your organization. This encourages collaboration and eases the onboarding process for your team members.

* Free users: Next to your avatar, select the menu to the right of **Upgrade**, then select **Manage Team**.
* Paid users: Next to your avatar, select **Team**, then select **Manage Team**.

On your Team Settings page, select **Team discovery** on the left, then select **Enable team discovery**. This will enable anyone from your domain to find and request to join your team.

> Team Admins will receive an email notification when team discovery is enabled.

You can optionally add a question for pending team members to answer when they request to join your team. Enter your question and select **Update Question**. Anyone who requests to join the team will be prompted with the question. If you do not specify a question, team members can still add a note when they request to join the team.

All users with the [Team Admin role](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) will be notified when someone makes a request to join your team, including their answer to any question you set, or an optional note.
