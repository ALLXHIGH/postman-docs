Collaborating in team workspaces

Team workspaces allow you to collaborate on APIs, collections, environments, integrations, mocks, and monitors with your team.

> Postman creates a default "Team Workspace" for every team. You can rename this workspace, but it cannot be deleted.

Postman notifies you when activities occur within your team workspace. You can opt in to or out of these notifications by selecting your avatar in the upper right and selecting **Notification Preferences**.

### Inviting a team member to a workspace

You can invite team members to join a [new](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/) or existing workspace. For more details about how to invite a team member to a workspace, see [Sharing workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/#sharing-workspaces).

### Finding teams within your organization

When you sign in to the Postman web dashboard using a verified email address for your company or organization, you can find available teams to join by selecting your avatar > **Your Team**. You will also be prompted with available teams when you first sign into your Postman account with a verified address.

[![Choose Team](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/join-team-from-list.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/join-team-from-list.jpg)

Select a team from the list of the available teams within your organization. Answer the question set by the Team Admin, if there is one. You can also add an optional note. Select **Request to join**.

Team Admins will receive a notification when you ask to join the team. Once they approve your request, you'll be able to access the team and collaborate on API projects within it.

### Leaving a team

You can leave a Postman team by navigating to your [Postman Dashboard](https://go.postman.co/home), selecting your avatar in the top right, then **Account Settings**. Select **Team** on the left. You can then opt to **Leave Team**.

> If your team has [SCIM configured](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/), you must contact your Postman Team Admins to leave the team.

When you leave a team, you no longer have access to the team's workspaces or any of the elements in them. You will still have access to your personal workspaces.

If you are the last member to leave your team, you will have the option to transfer collections to a personal workspace.

> If you are invited to a new team and you are the last member in your current team, all team data will be transferred to your personal default workspace.
