> **[The Private API Network is available on Postman Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing)**

The _Private API Network_ provides a [central directory](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-catalog/) of workspaces, collections, and APIs your team uses internally. Your Postman team can access these resources and start using them right away. By using the Private API Network, you can enable developers across your organization to discover, consume, and track API development in one place.

Workspaces, collections, and APIs in the Private API Network are visible to logged-in users who are on your Postman team. Users who aren't on your team can't find or access these resources.

Only [API Network Managers](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#network-roles) can manage all folders, the elements in them, and Folder Managers in your Private API Network. You can assign team members the [Folder Manager role](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#network-roles) at the folder level in your Private API Network, giving them permission to manage specific folders, the elements in them, and other Folder Managers in those folders.

> Enterprise teams can also assign this role to a user group. For more information about assigning team roles to groups, see [Managing user groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/).
