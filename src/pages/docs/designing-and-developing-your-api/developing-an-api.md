Once you have a schema in the Postman API Builder, you can develop your API using version tagging, and link it to mock servers, documentation, and environments.

> When you add documentation, test suites, mocks, monitors, and environments, only the elements in the current workspace will be visible. If an element is already linked to an API, it will not be visible.

## Adding a mock server

You can link mock servers for a collection to an API, by creating a new mock server, or adding / editing an existing one. From the API Builder **Develop** tab, click **Add Mock Server**.

### Creating a new mock server

In the __Add Mock Server__ dropdown, select **Create new mock server**.

You can base your mock server on different collections:

* **Generate collection from schema**: To create a mock server based on a collection generated from your schema, enter a name, configure how the collection should be generated by clicking **Show advanced settings**, and click **Generate Collection and Continue**
* **Use an existing collection**: Select a collection from the drop-down list and click **Select Collection and Continue**
* **Create a new collection**: To start a new collection for your mock server, enter the requests your collection will contain, and click **Create Collection and Continue**

### Adding an existing mock server

In the __Add Mock Server__ dropdown, select **Add existing mock server**.

Select a mock server from your workspace and click **Add Mock Server**. You will only see available mocks in the list. Your mock server will be added to the API.

![Mock Added](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/mock-added-schema.jpg)

You can add mocks to specific [versions of your API](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/versioning-an-api/) or [collection](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/).

### Editing a mock server

You can edit existing mock servers from an **API** by opening the **Develop** tab then hovering over the server in the **Mock Servers** section, and selecting the edit button.

Your [mock will open for editing](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/) in Postman.

You can also copy the URL of your mock server directly to your clipboard by clicking **Copy URL**.

## Adding documentation

You can link the documentation generated from your collections to specific versions of an API.

Select the collection with the documentation you want to link and click **Add Documentation**. You will only see available collections in the list.

You can add documentation to specific [versions of your API](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/versioning-an-api/). To learn more about versioning and documentation, check out [versioning your docs](/docs/publishing-your-api/documenting-your-api/#versioning-your-docs).

## Adding an environment

You can link specific environments in your workspaces to specific versions of an API. In the __API__ &gt; **Develop** tab, click **Add environment**.

![Add Environment to Schema](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/add-env-schema.jpg)

Select an environment from the list and click **Add environment**. You will only see available environments in the list.
