The watch option allows you to receive an email/in-app notification when a team member belonging to the same workspace modifies the API for example updating the schema, attaching an element to the API, adding a comment to the API and so on.

Once you've created the API, click the __watch__ option to start watching the API.

Click the bell icon on the top right corner to view the notification. The popup will indicate further information about the change that was made to the API.
