Datadog is an application performance management (APM) service that provides visibility for cloud-scale applications. The API Builder has a Datadog integration that enables you to access Datadog APM metrics from within Postman.

With this integration, you can link a version of your API in Postman to multiple services from Datadog. Each Datadog service corresponds to an API instance, such as `beta`, `prod1`, or `prod2`. You can also link multiple dashboards from Datadog to your API.

> **Want to send Postman monitor results to Datadog?** Sending monitor results to Datadog is a separate integration from viewing APM metrics in Postman. The integration in the API Builder has two tabs that cover both integrations. Learn more about [configuring a Postman monitor integration with Datadog](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/datadog/).
