Stay on top of your API deployments in Postman by connecting to [AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/). With this integration, you can view your API deployment status and history from within Postman. You can also deploy any version of your API directly from Postman to a stage in AWS API Gateway.

## Connecting to AWS API Gateway

To connect to AWS API Gateway in Postman, select **APIs** in the left sidebar, and then select the API and version you want to connect. Select the **Deployments** tab, and then select **AWS API Gateway**.

<img alt="Deployments AWS API Gateway" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/deployments-aws-api-gateway-v9.jpg"/>

When setting up the connection to AWS API Gateway, you can choose to authenticate by [creating an AWS IAM role](#authenticating-with-an-aws-iam-role) or by [using an AWS access key](#authenticating-with-an-aws-access-key). Follow the steps for your chosen method below.

> After connecting to AWS API Gateway, you have the option to deploy your API schema from Postman to the gateway. You can also deploy your API at a later time. Learn more about [deploying your API from Postman](#deploying-your-api-from-postman).

### Authenticating with an AWS IAM role

To set up a connection to AWS API Gateway using an AWS IAM role, select **IAM** under **AWS Authentication Mechanism**.

<img alt="Connecting with AWS IAM role" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/connect-to-api-gateway-with-iam-role-v9.jpg" width="400px"/>

Enter a **Nickname** for this integration and select the **AWS API Type** (HTTP or REST).

Next, create an IAM role for Postman in AWS:

1. Navigate to the [AWS IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/roles) and select **Create role**.
2. Under **Select type of trusted entity**, select **Another AWS account**.
3. Enter Postman's **AWS Account ID**: `258201882842`
4. Under options, select the check box to **Require external ID** and enter the **External ID** from Postman. (The external ID is displayed on the **Connect to AWS API Gateway** dialog box under **Step 1: Create an IAM role**.)

    > For more information, refer to the [AWS IAM guide on using external IDs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html).

5. Select **Next: Permissions**.
6. Select an existing IAM policy or select **Create policy**. If you are creating a policy, use the following JSON:

    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "Stmt909923626743",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "apigateway:GET"
                ],
                "Resource": [
                    "*"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

7. Select **Next: Tags**.
8. Select **Next: Review**.
9. Add a **Role name** and **Role description**, then select **Create role**.

Copy the **Role ARN** from AWS and paste it in Postman under **Step 2: Enter role ARN and region**. Next, enter the **AWS Region** where your API gateway is located and select the **API Gateway**. When you're ready, select **Connect** to connect to AWS API Gateway.

### Authenticating with an AWS access key

To set up a connection to AWS API Gateway using an AWS access key, select **Access Key** under **AWS Authentication Mechanism**.

<img alt="Connecting with AWS access key" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/connect-to-api-gateway-with-access-key.jpg" width="400px"/>

Next, enter information about the connection:

* Enter a **Nickname** for this integration.
* Select the **AWS API Type** (HTTP or REST).
* Enter the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** for your AWS account. (Learn how to [find your credentials in AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/getting-your-credentials.html).)
* Enter the **AWS Region** where your API gateway is located and select the **API Gateway**.

When you're ready, select **Connect** to connect to AWS API Gateway

## Viewing API deployments in Postman

After connecting to AWS API Gateway, you can view API deployment status and history in Postman. Select **APIs** in the left sidebar, select an API and version, and then select the **Deployments** tab.

<img alt="Deployed APIs" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/api-gateway-deployments-configured.jpg"/>

For each deployment you can view the ID, description, deployment date, status, and release. For each stage you can view the most recent deployment, the creation date, and the date last updated. Select a stage to view additional details, including the invoke URL, access logs, and execution logs.

* To open your AWS dashboard, select **View Dashboard**.
* To see the latest deployment status, select **Refresh**.
* To edit or delete the connection to AWS API Gateway, select the three dots <img alt="Three dots icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-three-dots-v9.jpg" width="18px" style="vertical-align:middle;margin-bottom:5px">.

## Deploying your API from Postman

Deploying an API schema makes it available on the connected API AWS Gateway, so users can start calling the API. Deploy your schema immediately after connecting an API version to AWS API Gateway, or deploy the schema later from the **Deployments** tab in the API Builder.

1. Open your API by selecting **APIs** in the left sidebar, and then selecting an API and a version.
1. Select the **Deployments** tab, and then select **Deploy Schema**.
1. Select the branch or release to deploy. Learn more about [versioning an API](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/versioning-an-api/).
1. Select the AWS stage to deploy the schema to, such as dev, prod, or beta

    If you do not want to deploy the schema to a stage, select the **Only Export Schema to HEAD** check box. The schema will be pushed to AWS API Gateway but will not be deployed to a stage. You can deploy the schema later from the AWS console.

1. Select **Deploy**.

> [API Gateway extensions to Open API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-swagger-extensions.html) (vendor extensions) are preserved when pushing and deploying the schema from Postman. Postman merges any extensions present on the gateway into the schema before pushing the merged schema to AWS API Gateway.
