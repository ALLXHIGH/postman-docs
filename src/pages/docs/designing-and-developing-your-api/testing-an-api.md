You can create collections to use as test suites, integration tests, or contract tests for your API. These collections can be linked to a specific version of your API.

* [Adding tests](#adding-tests)

## Adding tests

You can connect a test collection to an API version you have defined in the Postman API Builder. In the **Test** tab, next to **Tests**, select **Add Test**.

You can add a new or existing test:

* **Create new test**: Enter a name, configure how the collection should be generated by choosing **Show advanced settings**, and select **Create Test**.
* **Add existing test**: Choose an available collection from the list and select **Add Test**. You will only see available collections in the list.
