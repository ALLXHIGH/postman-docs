Testing is a critical part of the API development process. You can create a collection that contains your API tests and link it to your API. You can also integrate your API with supported Continuous Integration (CI) tools.

## Contents

* [Adding tests](#adding-tests)
* [Adding CI integration](#adding-ci-integration)

## Adding tests

You can connect a test collection to an API you have defined in the Postman API Builder.

To add tests to an API:

1. Select **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.
1. Under **Power up your API**, select **Test and Automation**.
1. Next to **Tests**, select **Add Test Suite**.
1. Add a new or existing test:

    * **Create new test** - Enter a name, configure how the collection will be generated by choosing **Show advanced settings**, and select **Create Test**.
    * **Add existing test** - Choose an available collection from the list and select **Add Test**.

## Adding CI integration

Postman integrates with some of the most widely used Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) tools. After you set up CI integration for your API, you can view the status of builds or start a new build, all from within Postman. You can also run API tests created in Postman as part of your CI pipeline.

To set up a CI integration:

1. Select **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.
1. Under **Power up your API**, select **Test and Automation**.
1. Under **Connect to CI/CD Builds**, select the integration you want to add.

To learn more about how CI integrations work, and for detailed configuration steps, see [CI integrations](/docs/integrations/ci-integrations/).
