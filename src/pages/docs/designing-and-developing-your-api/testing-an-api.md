You can create collections to use as test suites, integration tests, or contract tests for your API. These collections can be linked to a specific version of your API.

* [Adding a test suite](#adding-a-test-suite)
* [Adding integration tests](#adding-integration-tests)
* [Adding contract tests](#adding-contract-tests)

## Adding a test suite

You can connect a test suite to an API version you have defined in the Postman API Builder. In the **Test** tab, select **Add Test Suite**.

You can add a new or existing test suite:

* **Create new test suite**: Enter a name, configure how the collection should be generated by choosing **Show advanced settings**, and select **Generate Test Suite**.
* **Add existing test suite**: Choose an available collection from the list and select **Add Test Suite**. You will only see available collections in the list.

## Adding integration tests

In the **Test** tab, select **Add Integration Test** to check if your endpoints work as expected when combined with other APIs or services.

![Schema Integration Tests](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/api-builder-add-intregration-test.jpg)

Choose a corresponding collection from the list and select **Add Integration Test**. You will only see available collections in the list.

You can add a new or existing integration test:

* **Create new integration test**: Enter a name, configure how the collection should be generated by choosing **Show advanced settings**, and select **Generate Integration Test**.
* **Add existing integration test**: Choose an available collection from the list and select **Add Integration Test**. You will only see available collections in the list.

## Adding contract tests

If you're writing tests to ensure your API is working according to its specification, you can use **Contract tests**. In the **Test** tab, select **Add Contract Test**.

![Contract Test Schema](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/api-builder-add-contract-test.jpg)

You can add a new or existing contract test:

* **Create new contract test**: Enter a name, configure how the collection should be generated by choosing **Show advanced settings**, and select **Generate Contract Test**.
* **Add existing contract test**: Choose an available collection from the list and select **Add Contract Test**. You will only see available collections in the list.
