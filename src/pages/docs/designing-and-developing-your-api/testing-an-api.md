You can create collections to use as test suites, integration tests, or contract tests for your API. These collections can be linked to a specific version of your API. You can also integrate your API with supported Continuous Integration (CI) tools.

* [Adding a test suite](#adding-a-test-suite)
* [Adding integration tests](#adding-integration-tests)
* [Adding contract tests](#adding-contract-tests)
* [Adding CI integration](#adding-ci-integration)

## Adding a test suite

You can connect a test suite to any API you have defined in the Postman API Builder. In __API__ &gt; **Test** tab, click **Add Test Suite**.

You can add a new or existing test suite:

* **Create new test suite**: Enter a name, configure how the collection should be generated by clicking **Show advanced settings**, and click **Generate Test Suite**.
* **Add existing test suite**: Choose an available collection from the list and click **Add Test Suite**. You will only see available collections in the list.

## Adding integration tests

In __API__ &gt; **Test**, click **Add Integration Test** to check if your endpoints work as expected when combined with other APIs or services.

Select a corresponding collection from the list and click **Add Integration Test**. You will only see available collections in the list.

You can add a new or existing integration test:

* **Create new integration test**: Enter a name, configure how the collection should be generated by clicking **Show advanced settings**, and click **Generate Integration Test**.
* **Add existing integration test**: Choose an available collection from the list and click **Add Integration Test**. You will only see available collections in the list.

## Adding contract tests

If you're writing tests to ensure your API is working according to its specification, you can use **Contract tests**. In __API__ &gt; **Test**, click **Add Contract Test**.

![Contract Test Schema](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/api-builder-add-contract-test.jpg)

You can add a new or existing contract test:

* **Create new contract test**: Enter a name, configure how the collection should be generated by clicking **Show advanced settings**, and click **Generate Contract Test**.
* **Add existing contract test**: Choose an available collection from the list and click **Add Contract Test**. You will only see available collections in the list.

## Adding CI integration

Postman integrates with some of the most widely-used Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) tools. After you set up CI integration for your API, you can view the status of builds or kick off a new build, all from within Postman. You can also run API tests created in Postman as part of your CI pipeline.

To set up CI integration, go to **API > Test > Connect to CI/CD Builds** and select the integration you want to add. To learn more about how CI integrations work, and for detailed configuration steps, see [CI integrations](/docs/integrations/ci-integrations/).
