<!-- TODO: lede
observability
You use Postman Monitors to monitor the functionality and end to end performance of your APIs
-->

* [Using monitors](#using_monitors)
* [Viewing New Relic metrics](#viewing_new_relic_metrics)

## Using monitors

<!--TODO: change lede
Check an API's performance and response times at scheduled intervals.
-->

You can link monitors running on collections in your current workspace to an API. From the API Builder **Monitoring** tab, you can [create a new monitor](#creating-a-new-monitor), or [add an existing monitor](#adding-an-existing-monitor).

![Schema Monitors](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/schema-monitors.jpg)

### Creating a new monitor

In __API__ &gt; **Monitoring**, click __Add Monitor__ and choose **Create new monitor**. You can choose between [generating a collection from a schema](#generate-a-collection-from-a-schema), [using an existing collection](#use-an-existing-collection), or [creating a new collection](#create-a-new-collection).

#### Generate a collection from a schema

Specify a name for the collection, configure how the collection should be generated by clicking **Show advanced settings**, then click **Generate Collection and Continue**.

To add a monitor to a specific version of your collection, check out how to [set up monitors](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/monitoring-your-api/setting-up-monitor/).

## Viewing New Relic metrics

<!--TODO

Postman will become the central place to navigate  to various New Relic resources. You can link relevant dashboards and deployments to your API inside Postman.

With this integration, each API can be linked to

-   Multiple services from New Relic. Each service can correspond to a running instance of the API e.g. beta, prod1 and prod2.

-   Multiple dashboards from New Relic.

1. Set up monitors, then set up the New Relic integration to send metrics from Postman to New Relic. src/pages/docs/integrations/available-integrations/new-relic/
1. Set up services in New Relic?
1. Go to API version, **Monitoring** tab.
1. Under **Connect to APIM**, select **New Relic**.
1. Authenticate:
    1. nickname
    1. New Relic API Key
    1. New Relic region
    1. Select **Authenticate**.
1. Select Services:
    1. Services (explain)
    1. Link Dashboards (optional)
    1. Select **Connect**.
