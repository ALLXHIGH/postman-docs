## Setting up your team

Once you've created your Postman team, you can take the following steps to enable an efficient user onboarding process:

* Use the [Onboarding checklist](/docs/administration/onboarding-checklist/) to ensure that Postman is available on all devices used by your organization and that it functions as expected.
* [Enable team discovery](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/enabling-team-discovery/) to let other Postman users from your organization request to join your team.
* [Configure SSO](/docs/administration/sso/admin-sso/) ([Professional and Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing)).
* [Configure SCIM provisioning](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/) ([Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing)).

## Managing team members

You can invite collaborators, remove existing team members, and update user permissions at any time directly in Postman.
