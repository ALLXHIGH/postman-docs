## Enterprise features

Postman Enterprise has features for reporting, advanced identity management, API security and governance, collaboration, and administration.

### Reports

Postman Enterprise enables you to access reports that give you insights into the state of your APIs, including API creation, collection execution, and test runs. Reports also have information about your team's API consumption, performance, security posture, and SLA adherence. To learn more about reports, see [Using reports](/docs/reports/reports-overview/).

### Advanced identity management

Postman Enterprise gives you access to advanced identity management features, including:

* **Role-based access control (RBAC)** - Postman Enterprise RBAC enables you to give the right members of your team access to the right tools and data. To learn more about the team-level roles available to Enterprise teams, including Super Admin, Community Manager, and API Network Manager, see [Defining roles](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles).
* **User groups** - An Enterprise plan enables you to organize members of your team into groups, then assign roles and permissions according to each group's function. To learn more about user groups, see [Managing user groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/).
* **Single sign-on (SSO)** - You can enable your team members to sign in to Postman Enterprise using your organization's [identity provider](/docs/administration/sso/intro-sso/#identity-providers-supported). To learn more about setting up SSO for your team, see [Intro to SSO](/docs/administration/sso/intro-sso/).
* **System for cross-domain identity management (SCIM)** - Setting up SCIM enables you to automatically provision and de-provision team members and organize them into [user groups](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/user-groups/). To learn more about enabling SCIM for your team, see [SCIM provisioning](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/).
* **Domain capture** - Domain capture enables you to consolidate all your organization's users into a single Postman team and ensure that any new users who sign up for Postman with your domain are automatically added. To learn more about setting up domain capture, see [Configuring domain capture](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/configuring-domain-capture/).

### API security and governance features

Postman Enterprise provides you with advanced API security and governance features:

* **Custom token scanner** - Create a [custom token scanner](/docs/administration/token-scanner/#custom-alerts) to proactively check for security leaks.
* **Public link governance** - View and manage elements like workspaces, documentation, and collection links that your team [makes public](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/manage-public-elements/).
* **Audit logs** - Use [audit logs](/docs/administration/audit-logs/) to understand how your team members are using Postman.
* **API governance and API security warnings** - Make use of governance and security warnings that enable you to apply standards consistently throughout your API development process's [design](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/api-definition-warnings/) and [testing](/docs/api-governance/api-testing/api-testing-warnings/) phases. You can also use the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) to return governance and security warnings.
### Collaboration

Postman Enterprise enables your organization to collaborate internally and with partners:

* **Private API Network** - Users with the Enterprise-only API Network Manager role can approve which APIs to add to your Private API Network. For more information, see [Using the approval process workflow](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/adding-private-network/#using-the-approval-process-workflow).
* **Partner workspaces** - Your organization can invite partners to a shared workspace to collaborate and build products and services with your APIs. To learn more about partner workspaces, see [TODO this URL doesn't exist yet](#TODO).
* **Advanced version control** - Manage permissions for reviewers and assign merge checks for forks on Postman elements. For more details, see [Pull request settings](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/version-control/#pull-request-settings).
* **Native Git support** - Connect your API to a new or existing repository, then make edits to the API and view all the commits in source control [TODO this URL doesn't exist yet](#TODO).
* **Static IP monitoring** - Use collection-based monitors to monitor APIs that are behind a restricted firewall. To learn more about static IP monitoring, see [Running monitors using static IPs](/docs/monitoring-your-api/using-static-IPs-to-monitor/).

### Administration

After you purchase a Postman Enterprise plan, you can customize it to meet your organization's needs:

* **Postman Enterprise app** - The [Postman Enterprise app](/docs/administration/managing-enterprise-deployment/) is a version of the Postman desktop app that offers greater control to administrators. After you purchase a Postman Enterprise plan, you can use the Enterprise app to manage deployment and installations within your organization.
* **App versioning** - Set a team-wide version of the Postman desktop app for your organization. To learn more about app versioning, see [Managing Postman app versioning](/docs/administration/managing-enterprise-deployment/#managing-postman-app-versioning).
* **Enterprise integrations** - Some integrations, including [Azure DevOps](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/azure-devops/), [GitHub Enterprise Server](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/github/), and [GitLab Self-Managed](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/gitlab/), are only available with an Enterprise plan.

## Postman Enterprise trial

If you're interested in trying out Postman Enterprise for your organization, you can evaluate the platform through a free trial.

To start the trial, you must have an [Admin role](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) on your team. Select **Start Enterprise Trial**. <!-- TODO: since the CTA will be available in a lot of different spots, rolled out at different times, it may not make sense to include this at all -->

If you don't have a Postman account, you will be prompted to [sign up for Postman](/docs/getting-started/postman-account/#signing-up-for-a-postman-account) and [create a team](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/collaboration-overview/#creating-a-team) before you can start a trial of Postman Enterprise.

### Accessing Postman features during the trial

During the trial, you'll have access to the full range of Enterprise features Postman offers. See the [Enterprise features](#enterprise-features) section for more information about Enterprise-only capabilities.

> During the trial, you won't be able to use the Postman Enterprise app. The Postman Enterprise app is a version of the Postman desktop app that offers greater control to administrators.

### Upgrading to Postman Enterprise during or after your trial

If you decide to upgrade to Postman Enterprise or a different paid plan during or after your trial, contact the [Postman sales team](https://www.postman.com/company/contact-sales/) to get started. <!-- TODO: is there a url + utm to use here? -->

If you decide not to upgrade after your trial period is over, you will return to your original plan. If you didn't already have a Postman account before starting the trial, your plan will switch to a [Free plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).

## Purchasing a Postman Enterprise plan

To purchase a Postman Enterprise plan, contact the [Postman sales team](https://www.postman.com/company/contact-sales/). The sales team will evaluate your organization's needs, including the number of team member slots and any [add-ons](/docs/administration/billing/#managing-add-ons). To learn more, see [Purchasing Postman](/docs/administration/buying/). Afterwards, a member of the Postman team will help set up Postman Enterprise for your organization.
