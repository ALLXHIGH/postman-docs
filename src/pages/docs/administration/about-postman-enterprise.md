## Postman Enterprise trial

If you're interested in trying out Postman Enterprise for your company, you can evaluate the service during a free 30 day trial. During the 30 day trial, you will be able to access the full range of features available in Postman Enterprise.

To start the trial, you must have an [Admin role](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles).

If you have an existing Postman account, you can initiate the trial from the [Postman website](https://www.postman.com/postman-enterprise/), from the [Edit plan]() or [Upgrade]() pages, or from features in the Postman app that are only available to Enterprise teams (for example, <things go here>). If you have a [Billing role]() in addition to your Admin role, you can initial the trial from the [Billing dashboard]().

> If you don't already have a Postman account, you need to [sign up for Postman](/docs/getting-started/postman-account/#signing-up-for-a-postman-account) and [create a team](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/collaboration-overview/#creating-a-team) before you can start a trial of Postman Enterprise.

If you decide to upgrade to Postman Enterprise during or after your trial, contact the [Postman sales team]() to get started.

If you decide not to upgrade after your trial period is over, you will return to your original plan. If you did not have a Postman account before starting the trial, your plan will switch to a [Free plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
