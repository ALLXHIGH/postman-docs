Postman provides you with a limited number of resources you can use each month, depending on your Postman plan. Monthly resources include the number of calls to the Postman API , requests run by monitors and scheduled collection runs, mock server requests, serverless requests, and cloud agent requests. Your Postman plan also has other limits, such as the number of integrations you can create, the number of custom domains, and image file storage.

 To find out what the resource limits are for your plan, see the Postman Pricing page. To view the resources you are currently using, go to your Resource Usage dashboard. If you need additional resources, you can purchase an add-on or upgrade your plan.

See the following sections to understand what happens when your resource usage reaches the limits set by your Postman plan.
