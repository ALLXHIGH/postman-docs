> __[The Postman Enterprise Application is only available to Postman Enterprise teams and is currently in beta.](https://www.postman.com/pricing)__

Postman's Enterprise Application is a variant of Postmanâ€™s Desktop Application that offers greater control to administrators looking to deploy Postman at an enterprise level. It is available as an MSI package for Windows and supports silent installation, system-wide installation, and additional configurations to control how Postman is installed on users' devices.

To get started, reach out to your Postman Account Manager or [contact Postman support](https://www.postman.com/support/).

## Installing the Postman Enterprise app

Once you've downloaded the Postman Enterprise MSI package, you can move forward with installing the app.

### INSTALLDIR

The `INSTALLDIR` public property is used to select a custom installation. If this public property is not manually overwritten, it defaults to `%PROGRAMFILES%\[company]\[name]` for system-wide installations and `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\[company]\[name]` for per-user installations.

For example, you can run the following command to perform a system-wide installation to a custom directory:

```
msiexec /i path/to/package.msi INSTALLDIR=C:\custom
```

### MSIINSTALLPERUSER

The standard `MSIINSTALLPERUSER` option is used to install the application per-user instead of system-wide. By default, the MSI performs a system-wide installation. Set `MSIINSTALLPERUSER` to `1` to perform a per-user installation.

For example, you can run the following command to perform a per-user installation to the default installation directory:

```
msiexec /i path/to/package.msi MSIINSTALLPERUSER=1
```

This public property can be used in conjunction with `INSTALLDIR` to perform a per-user installation to a custom directory:

```
msiexec /i path/to/package.msi MSIINSTALLPERUSER=1 INSTALLDIR=%USERPROFILE%\custom
```

### Silent installation

A silent installation or uninstallation is performed by passing the `/qn` option to `msiexec`:

```
msiexec /i path\to\package.msi /qn MSIINSTALLPERUSER=1
```

Note that running in silent installation mode will omit error messages. If the installation fails for any reason, `%ERRORLEVEL%` will not equal `0` but no error will be displayed.

It is always recommended to [run silent installations with logging enabled](#enabling-verbose-logging-for-installation).

### Enabling verbose logging for installation

The `msiexec` tool can be configured to output debug log information about the installation process with the `/l*v` option. For example, you can output debug information to `C:\log.txt`:

```
msiexec /i path\to\package.msi /l*v C:\log.txt
```

## Uninstalling the Postman Enterprise app

The `msiexec` command-line tool can be used to remove an existing application using the `/x` option:

```
msiexec /x path\to\package.msi  
```

The application can also be removed from the Add/Remove Programs section in system settings or from the system Control Panel application.
