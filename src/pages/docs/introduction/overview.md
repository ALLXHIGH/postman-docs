Welcome to the Postman docs! This is the place to find official information on how to use Postman in your API projects.

<!-- TODO: longer lede, then a transition to contents -->

If you're learning to carry out a specific task or workflow in Postman, check out the following topics to find resources:
<!-- TODO: contents -->

## Getting started

<!-- TODO: FIX -->

[getting started](/docs/getting-started/overview/).

## Sending requests

<!-- TODO: FIX -->

* [__Send your first request!__](/docs/getting-started/sending-the-first-request/)

[Sending requests](/docs/sending-requests/requests/)

## Writing scripts

<!-- TODO: FIX -->

[Writing scripts](/docs/writing-scripts/intro-to-scripts/)

## Running collections
<!-- TODO: FIX -->

[Running collections](/docs/running-collections/running-collections-overview/)

## Using Postman Flows

Postman Flows is a visual tool for creating API workflows. You can use flows to chain requests, handle data, and create real-world workflows in your Postman workspace.

To learn more about Postman Flows, see the [Postman Flows overview](/docs/postman-flows/gs/flows-overview/).

## Using the Postman CLI

The Postman CLI is a secure command-line companion for Postman. You can use the Postman CLI to run a collection, send run results to Postman, check API definitions against configured API Governance and API Security rules, and more.

To learn more about the Postman CLI, see the [Postman CLI overview](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/).

## Collaborating in Postman

Postman provides a variety of tools to enable and enhance collaboration within your team. You can create team workspaces, where team members can share their work and collaborate on API projects. Users can also discuss their work directly in Postman by commenting on collections and APIs, including on specific requests, versions, and inline on schemas and scripts.

To learn more about collaboration in Postman, see the [collaboration overview](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/collaboration-overview/).

## Designing and developing your API

<!-- TODO: FIX -->

[API workflow](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/the-api-workflow/)

## Documenting your API

Documentation is an important part of any collection or API. Good documentation helps the people who use your collection to understand what it does and how each request works. And comprehensive API documentation lets your consumers know what endpoints are available and how to interact with them.

Once you've generated documentation for your collection or API, users can view the documentation in Postman. By default your documentation is private, so you must share a collection or API with others before they can access it. If you're creating a public API, you can publish your documentation to make it publicly available to anyone with a web browser.

To learn more about documenting your API, see [Generating API documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/documenting-your-api/).

## Monitoring your API

<!-- TODO: FIX -->

[Monitoring](/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/)

## API Governance and Security

<!-- TODO: FIX -->

[Governance and security](/docs/api-governance/api-governance-overview/)

## Administration

<!-- TODO: FIX -->

[Administration](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/)

## Using reports

Postman generates reports that enable you to visualize data for how your team uses Postman. These reports give you insights into the state of your APIs, including tests, documentation, and monitoring coverage. They also enable you to track performance and SLA adherence.

To learn more about how to use reports, see [reports overview](/docs/reports/reports-overview/).

## Developer resources

<!-- TODO: FIX -->

[Developer resources](/docs/developer/resources-intro/)

## Integrations

You can connect Postman to your API workflows with integrations for popular third-party solutions. Use integrations to automatically share data between Postman and the other tools you rely on for API development. For more information, see [integrating with Postman](/docs/integrations/intro-integrations/).

## OLD BELOW HERE

### Making requests

If you're building a client app or want to connect to an API, check out some Postman essentials:

* [Connecting to APIs](/docs/sending-requests/requests/)
* [Authorizing requests](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/)
* [Grouping requests in collections](/docs/sending-requests/intro-to-collections/)
* [Using variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/)
* [Visualizing data](/docs/sending-requests/visualizer/)

### Testing APIs

If you're testing an API, you can use Postman to automate various parts of the process:

* [Writing test scripts](/docs/writing-scripts/test-scripts/)
* [Automating workflows with the collection runner](/docs/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/)
* [Capturing HTTP requests](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/capturing-http-requests/)
* [Test script examples](/docs/writing-scripts/script-references/test-examples/)

### Building and managing APIs

If you're developing a back-end, working API-first, or need to monitor API performance, Postman utilities can streamline your workflows:

* [Defining an API from a schema](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/the-api-workflow/)
* [Monitoring test runs](/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/)
* [Analyzing API performance](/docs/reports/reports-overview/)
* [Mocking responses](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/)

### Developing with Postman

If you're integrating Postman with your CI/CD workflow or are developing with Postman APIs or libraries, check out these resources:

* [Integrating with a development pipeline](/docs/running-collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/)
* [Developing with Postman utilities](/docs/developer/resources-intro/)
* [Postman API](/docs/developer/intro-api/)
