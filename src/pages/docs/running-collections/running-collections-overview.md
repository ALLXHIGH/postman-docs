Postman enables you to run collections in several ways. You can:

* [Run collections manually](/docs/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/), with the Collection Runner.
* Run collections on a schedule, with [scheduled collection runs](/docs/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs) or [monitors](/docs/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs-monitors).
* Trigger collections with [webhooks](/docs/running-collections/collection-webhooks/).
* Run collections with [data files](/docs/running-collections/working-with-data-files/).
* Customize a collection's run order with [request workflows](/docs/running-collections/building-workflows/).
