Postman enables you to run collections in several ways. You can:

* [Run collections manually](/docs/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/), with the Collection Runner.
* Run collections on a schedule, with [scheduled collection runs](/docs/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs) or [monitors](/docs/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs-monitors).
* Automate collection runs with the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) and [Newman](/docs/running-collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/).
* Trigger collection runs with [webhooks](/docs/running-collections/collection-webhooks/).
