The **API Governance** report dashboard provides metrics relevant to your team's [API Governance](/docs/api-governance/api-governance-overview/) rule compliance. This section has two reports:

* [Public APIs](#public-apis)
* [Private Network APIs](#private-network-apis)

## Public APIs

The **Public APIs** report provides the following information for APIs in your team's [public workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/public-workspaces/) over the past 30 days:

* **Conformance** - The number of APIs in your team's public workspaces that don't have any API Governance rule violations.
* **Non-conformance** - The average number of API Governance rule violations per API in your team's public workspaces.
* **API conformance over time** - Per day over the last 30 days, the number of APIs without API Governance rule violations and the number of APIs with API Governance rule violations.
* **Current API landscape** - The number of APIs in your team's public workspaces, broken down by the number of API Governance rule violations in each.
* **Top 3 rules violated** - The three API Governance rules that are most frequently violated in APIs in your team's public workspaces.
