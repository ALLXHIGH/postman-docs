You can use Postman's New Relic integration to view all your operational data in one place. This integration allows you to configure your Postman monitors to send metrics to New Relic.

If you don't already have a [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/), you'll need to create one.

## Configuring New Relic Integration

From the [Integrations page](https://postman.postman.co/integrations/browse?category=all), search and select the New Relic integration.
