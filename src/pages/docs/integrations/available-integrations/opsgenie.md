OpsgenieÂ is a real-time incident management platform that allows you to monitor system incidents and alert the correct team members as soon as possible.

## Incidents on VictorOps

An alert on Opsgenie consists of the basic information of which monitor failed, with the number of errors and failed tests. It also provides a direct link to the failing monitor. This integration automatically acknowledges a triggered incident if the subsequent run succeeds.

When there is an alert on Postman, you will also see one on your Opsgenie console.
