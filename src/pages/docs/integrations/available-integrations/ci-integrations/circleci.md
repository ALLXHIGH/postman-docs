CircleCI is a cloud-based continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform. Software development teams use CircleCI to run build jobs, automate tests, and orchestrate complex workflows.

To set up CircleCI integration for your API, youâ€™ll need to create an API token in CircleCI and configure your API in Postman. After you set up the integration, you can view the status of builds or kick off a new build, all from within Postman.

## Creating a CircleCI API Token

1. Log into [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/settings/user/tokens) and navigate to **User Settings > Personal API Tokens**.
1. Select **Create New Token**.
1. Enter a **Token Name** and select **Add API Token**.
1. Select **Copy** to copy the new token. (You might want to save the token somewhere safe.)

## Configuring CircleCI integration

1. From the Postman **[Home](https://go.postman.co/home)** page select **[Integrations](https://go.postman.co/integrations)**.
1. Search for and select **CircleCI**. Then select **Add integration**.
1. Enter your CircleCI token and select the check box to agree to let Postman store your token. Then select **Authenticate and Proceed**.

1. Configure the integration:
    * Enter a **Nickname** to help you recognize the integration later.
    * Select the workspace your API is in.
    * Select the API to use.
    * Select the API version to use. *Each API version can be linked to only one CI project*.
    * Select the CI project used for your API.
1. Select **Add Integration**.

> You can also set up a CI integration from within your API. Open your API and select the **Test** tab. Under **Connect to CI/CD Builds**, select the integration you want to add.

## Configuring Newman for CircleCI

With the help of Newman and the Postman API, you can run API tests created in Postman as part of your CI pipeline. First [generate the Newman configuration code](/docs/integrations/ci-integrations/#configuring-newman-for-ci) in Postman. Then add the configuration code to CircleCI:

1. Open your project in CircleCI, select a branch, and then select **Edit Config**.
1. Paste the Newman configuration you copied from Postman:
    * Replace both instances of `$POSTMAN_API_KEY` with a valid [Postman API Key](/docs/developer/intro-api/#generating-a-postman-api-key).
    * Make sure to add the `newman-collection-run` job to a new or existing workflow.
1. Select **Save and Run** to run the pipeline using the new configuration.
1. To view the test results in Postman, open your API and select the **Tests** tab.
