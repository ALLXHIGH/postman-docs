[Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/) is a continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) service that's integrated with Microsoft Azure DevOps. Software development teams can use Azure Pipelines to automatically build, test, and deploy code in Azure DevOps.

To set up an Azure DevOps Pipelines integration for your API, first create a repository in a [version control system supported by Azure Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/repos/). Create a pipeline in the repository, and then configure your API in Postman. After you set up the integration, you can view the status of builds (pipelines) from within Postman.

> Azure DevOps Pipelines integration isn't available on Azure DevOps Server (hosted on-premises).

## Creating a pipeline in Azure DevOps

If you haven't already, create a repository in a version control system supported by Azure Pipelines. To create a pipeline, add a YAML file in your repository. You define your pipeline in this YAML file. To learn more, see [the Azure Pipelines documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/pipelines-get-started).

## Configuring an Azure DevOps Pipelines integration

1. Open your API by selecting **APIs** in the sidebar, and then selecting an API and a version. *Each API version can be linked to one CI project*.
1. Select the **Test** tab.
1. Under **Connect to CI/CD Builds**, select **Azure DevOps**.
1. You'll be prompted to allow Postman to access your Azure DevOps account. After you grant access, you can close the browser tab and return to Postman.
1. Enter a **Nickname** to help you recognize the integration later. Postman pre-fills a nickname in the format `Azure DevOps Pipelines-{API_NAME}`, and you can edit it if you want.
1. Enter the Azure DevOps **Organization Name** where you created the project pipeline.
1. Select the **CI project** used for your API.
1. Select **Connect**.

## Viewing build status

After you set up an Azure DevOps Pipelines integration, information for build jobs (pipeline runs) is available in Postman. For each build you can view the branch, start time, duration, and status (`Succeeded` or `Failed`). You can also view the results of collection runs that are [configured in your pipeline using the Postman CLI](#viewing-collection-run-details).

To view build jobs, open an API version and select the **Test** tab. The most recent jobs are listed under **CI/CD Builds**.

> You can't start Azure Pipelines builds directly in Postman. To start a new build, go to Azure DevOps.

Select **View All Builds** to view the full list of build jobs. From here you can take the following actions:

* Use the dropdown lists to filter jobs by branch or build status.
* To view a build in Azure DevOps, select the build name.
* To get the latest build status information, select <img alt="Refresh icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-refresh-v9-5.jpg#icon" width="14px"> **Refresh**.
* To edit or delete the integration, select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px">.
* To view more details for a build, use the arrows to expand a build and expand **Build Steps**. For each build step you can view the name, duration, and status.

## Viewing collection run details

Using the Postman CLI, you can run Postman collections with your API tests as part of an Azure DevOps pipeline.

To view details for collections that were run as part of a build, first [configure the Postman CLI for Azure DevOps Pipelines](#configuring-the-postman-cli-for-azure-devops-pipelines) and then start a new build in Azure DevOps. To learn more about starting builds, see [the Azure Pipelines documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/runs). After the build is complete, use the arrows to expand a build and expand **Collection Runs**. Then expand a collection to view details about a collection run.

<img alt="View Azure DevOps Pipelines collection runs" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/bitbucket-pipelines-collection-runs-v9-19.jpg">

> Select **View Report** to view a collection run report in the Postman **History**. Learn more about using the [Collection Runner](/docs/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/).

## Configuring the Postman CLI for Azure DevOps Pipelines

With the help of the Postman CLI and the Postman API, you can run API tests created in Postman as part of your Azure DevOps pipeline. First generate the Postman CLI configuration code in Postman. Then add the configuration code to the YAML file in your repository.

Each time the pipeline runs, the Postman CLI runs the collections that contain your tests. You can view the results of your tests in Postman.

> Before you begin, make sure youâ€™ve already [set up an integration](#configuring-an-azure-devops-pipelines-integration) between your API version and Azure DevOps Pipelines.

To generate configuration code for the Postman CLI:

1. Open your API version and select the **Test** tab.
1. Under **CI/CD Builds**, select **View All Builds**.
1. Select **Configure Postman CLI**.
1. Select a **Collection** to run during pipeline builds. To be available in the list, you must first [add the collection as a test suite](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/testing-an-api/#adding-tests) to your API. You can also select an **Environment** to use.
1. (Optional) Select the check box to test the API's schema against configured governance and security rules.
1. Select the **Operating system** for your CI/CD pipeline.
1. Select <img alt="Copy icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-copy-v9.jpg#icon" width="15px"> **Copy** to copy the Postman CLI configuration, and then select **Finish**.

<img alt="Generate the Postman CLI configuration" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/generate-postman-cli-v10.jpg" width="548px">

To add the Postman CLI configuration to your Azure DevOps pipeline:

1. Create a new YAML file in your repository, and then edit the file.
1. Add the Postman CLI configuration you copied from Postman to the YAML file:
    * Replace all instances of `$(POSTMAN_API_KEY)` and `${POSTMAN_API_KEY}` with a valid [Postman API Key](/docs/developer/intro-api/#generating-a-postman-api-key).
1. Commit and push the changes to your remote repository. This will automatically start a build in Azure DevOps.
1. To view the test results in Postman, open your API and select the **Test** tab. Learn more about [Viewing collection run details](#viewing-collection-run-details).
