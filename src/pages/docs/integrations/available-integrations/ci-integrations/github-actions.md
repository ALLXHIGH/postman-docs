[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) is a continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) service that's integrated with GitHub. Software development teams can use GitHub Actions to automatically build, test, and deploy code in GitHub.

To set up a GitHub Actions integration for your API, first create a pipeline in GitHub and then configure your API in Postman. After you set up the integration, you can view the status of builds from within Postman.

## Creating a pipeline in GitHub

If you haven't already, create a pipeline in the GitHub repository you use for your API. To create a pipeline, create a directory in your repository named `.github/workflows`, and then add a YAML file to the directory. You define your pipeline in this YAML file. To learn more, see [the GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows).

## Configuring a GitHub Actions integration

To configure a GitHub Actions integration:

1. Open your API by selecting **APIs** in the sidebar, and then selecting an API and a version. *Each API version can be linked to one CI project*.
1. Select the **Test** tab.
1. Under **Connect to CI/CD Builds**, select **GitHub**.
1. You'll be prompted to allow Postman to access your GitHub account. After you grant access, you can close the browser tab and return to Postman.
1. Enter a **Nickname** to help you recognize the integration later.
1. Select the GitHub **Organization** with your API repository.
1. Select the **Repository** used for your API.
1. Select **Connect**.

## Viewing build status

After you set up a GitHub Actions integration, information for build jobs is available in Postman. For each build you can view the branch, start time, and status (`Success` or `Failure`). You can also view the results of collection runs that are [configured in your pipeline using Newman](#viewing-collection-run-details).

To view build jobs, open an API version and select the **Test** tab. The most recent jobs are listed under **CI/CD Builds**.

> You can't start GitHub Actions builds directly in Postman. To start a new build, go to GitHub.

Select **View All Builds** to view the full list of build jobs. From here you can take the following actions:

* Use the dropdown lists to filter jobs by branch or build status.
* To view a build in GitHub, select the build name.
* To get the latest build status information, select <img alt="Refresh icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-refresh-v9-5.jpg#icon" width="14px"> **Refresh**.
* To edit or delete the integration, select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px">.
* To view more details for a build, use the arrows to expand a build and expand **Build Steps**. For each build step you can view the name, duration, and status.

## Viewing collection run details

Using Newman, you can run Postman collections with your API tests as part of a GitHub pipeline. The Postman cloud reporter can send details about the collection runs back to Postman.

To view details for collections that were run as part of a build, first [configure Newman for GitHub](#configuring-newman-for-github-actions) and then start a new build in GitHub. To learn more about starting builds, see [the GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow). After the build is complete, use the arrows to expand a build and expand **Collection Runs**. Then expand a collection to view details about a collection run.

<img alt="View GitHub Actions collection runs" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/gitlab-collection-runs-v9-19.jpg">

> Select **View Report** to view a collection run report in the Postman **History**. Learn more about using the [Collection Runner](/docs/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/).

## Configuring Newman for GitHub Actions

With the help of Newman and the Postman API, you can run API tests created in Postman as part of your GitHub pipeline. First generate the Newman configuration code in Postman. Then add the configuration code to the YAML file in the `.github/workflows` directory in your GitHub repository.

Each time the pipeline runs, Newman runs the collections that contain your tests. You can view the results of your tests in Postman. You an also configure the [Postman cloud reporter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman-reporter-postman-cloud) to send detailed collection run information back to Postman.

> Before you begin, make sure youâ€™ve already [set up an integration](#configuring-a-github-actions-integration) between your API version and GitHub Actions.

To generate configuration code for Newman:

1. Open your API version and select the **Test** tab.
1. Under **CI/CD Builds**, select **View All Builds**.
1. Select **Configure Newman**.
1. Select a **Collection** to run during pipeline builds. To be available in the dropdown list, you must first [add the collection as a test suite](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/testing-an-api/#adding-tests) to your API. You can also select an **Environment** to use.

    > If needed, select **+ Add More** to select other collections to run.

1. (Optional) Select the checkbox to use the Postman cloud reporter to send collection run information back to Postman. You can view the collection run details in the Postman **History** and on the API version **Test** tab.
1. Select **Copy** to copy the Newman configuration, and then select **Finish**.

   <img alt="Generate Newman configuration" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/gitlab-ci-generate-newman-v9-16.jpg" width="447px" />

To add the Newman configuration to your GitHub pipeline:

1. Edit the YAML file in the `.github/workflows` directory in your GitHub repository.
1. Add the Newman configuration you copied from Postman to the YAML file:
    * Replace all instances of `$POSTMAN_API_KEY` with a valid [Postman API Key](/docs/developer/intro-api/#generating-a-postman-api-key).
1. Commit and push the changes to your remote repository.
1. In GitHub, open the repository from the dashboard. Then start a new build.
1. To view the test results in Postman, open your API and select the **Test** tab. Learn more about [Viewing collection run details](#viewing-collection-run-details).
