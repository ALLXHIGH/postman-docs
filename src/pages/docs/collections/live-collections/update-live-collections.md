title: "Updating Live Collections"
updated: 2023-03-15

Whenever we detect a change in the API traffic, we will notify the user that an update to the collection is available through the following:

* Email - An email will be sent out for every update available. This will take them directly to the update workflow
* Notification - A pop up notification will be generated whenever an update is available.

An updates available label will be present in the collection view. You can do the following:

* A quick update option where the updates are already pre-selected. You can review the changes and unselect updates to any endpoints that they do not want to perform
* An option to do a more detailed update by reviewing the changes to each endpoint and picking specific changes that you want to apply

## Viewing changes in a Live Collection

To see changes made to a Live Collection, use the collection changelog. The changelog for the collection shows the updates that have been made to a Live Collection.

To see the changelog, open the collection and select the changelog icon <img alt="Changelog icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-changelog-v9.jpg#icon" width="18px"> on the right.
