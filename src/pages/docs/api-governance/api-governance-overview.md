API governance is the application of rules that promote consistent API behaviors across your organization's API landscape. API security is the application of rules that promote security-first API behaviors. The _Postman API Governance_ and _Postman API Security_ features can identify inconsistencies or weaknesses in your APIs, then recommend possible fixes or improvements. These features can enable you to create better and more secure APIs that follow industry best practices.

By automatically applying Postman API Governance and API Security rules at the beginning of API development, you can automate your governance and security review processes instead of relying on manual reviews. Consistently enforcing Postman API Governance and API Security standards enables you to develop high-quality APIs and streamlines collaboration across all parts of the API development lifecycle.  

Postman applies API Governance and API Security rules at the following phases of API development:

* **API definition** - Postman applies API Governance and API Security rules to your [API definition](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/api-definition-warnings/) and shows rule violations that might impact your definition's governance and security postures.
* **Requests** - Postman applies API Security rules configured for your [API requests](/docs/api-governance/api-testing/api-testing-warnings/) when you send requests to any API using either the Postman web app or the Postman desktop app.
