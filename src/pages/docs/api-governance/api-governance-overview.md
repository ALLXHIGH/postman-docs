_API governance_ is the practice of applying standards consistently across your API design and testing phases of your development process. This consistency reduces friction and streamlines collaboration across all parts of the API development lifecycle.

Postmanâ€™s API governance features offer you guidance for APIs at the design and testing phases. By identifying possible inconsistencies or weak points and pointing out possible fixes or improvements, Postman enables you to create secure APIs that follow industry best-practices.

Postman applies API governance rules at the following phases of API development:

* **API design** - Postman applies governance rules to your [API definition](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/api-definition-warnings/) and shows warnings about your definition's format and security posture.
* **API testing** - Postman applies governance rules to your [API requests](/docs/api-governance/api-testing/api-testing-warnings/) and shows warnings about issues that might impact their security posture.
