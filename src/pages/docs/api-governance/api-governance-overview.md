Postmanâ€™s _API Governance_ and _API Security_ features offer you guidance for APIs as you design your API definition and send requests. Applying standards consistently helps you to develop high-quality APIs and streamlines collaboration across all parts of the API development lifecycle. By identifying possible inconsistencies or weak points and pointing out possible fixes or improvements, Postman enables you to create better and more secure APIs that follow industry best practices.

Postman applies API Governance and API Security rules at the following phases of API development:

* **API definition** - Postman applies governance and security rules to your [API definition](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/api-definition-warnings/) and shows rule violations that might impact your definition's governance and security postures.
* **Requests** - Postman applies security rules to your [API requests](/docs/api-governance/api-testing/api-testing-warnings/) and shows rule violations that might impact your API's security posture.
