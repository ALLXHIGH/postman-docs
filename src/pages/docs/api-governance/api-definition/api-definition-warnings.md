Postman recommends that you follow API Governance and API Security rules when you create your API definition. A rule violation doesn't mean that your API definition is broken! Instead, it indicates that there are potential security risks that your API might be vulnerable to, or potential design issues that might impact its usability. Postman highlights these rule violations and helps you understand their implications and possible ways to fix them. Postman supports API Governance and API Security rules for API definitions in [OpenAPI 3.0](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/openapi3/) and [OpenAPI 2.0](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/openapi2/) format.

## Viewing governance and security rule violations in the API definition

After you [create a new API](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/creating-an-api/), select the **Definition** tab on the API overview page to inspect any API Governance or API Security rule violations found in the API definition, if any. To learn more about using rule violations to create consistent and secure API definitions, see [Viewing rule violations in your API definition](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/developing-an-api/defining-an-api/#viewing-rule-violations-in-your-API-definition). <!-- TODO: this is a new URL, must validate before merging to develop -->

## Tracking governance and security rule violations in CI/CD

> [The Postman CLI is only available to Postman Enterprise teams.](https://www.postman.com/pricing)

You can configure your CI/CD pipelines to enforce the [API Governance](/docs/api-governance/configuring-api-governance-rules/) and [API Security](/docs/api-governance/configuring-api-security-rules/) rules configured for your team with the help of [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/).

On the Postman CLI configuration page, select **Run governance and security rules on the schema of this API**. This will generate the Postman CLI configuration that you can paste in your CI/CD configuration to enforce the API Governance and API Security rules each time the CI/CD pipeline runs.

To see the results, go to the build page and select the desired build. Next, select the API definition to expand it and see the buildâ€™s results and any rule violations, if applicable.

For the list of all the warnings that Postman might show at the API definition phase of development, see [OpenAPI 3.0 warnings](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/openapi3/) and [OpenAPI 2.0 warnings](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/openapi2/).
