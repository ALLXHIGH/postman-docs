> **This feature is in beta.** During the beta period, it may not be available to all Postman users and is subject to potential change.

Postman recommends that you follow common security best practices at the API testing phase of API development. A security warning doesn't mean that your API is broken! Instead, it indicates that there are potential security risks that your API might be vulnerable to. Postman highlights these security warnings and helps you understand their implications and possible ways to patch the warnings.

## Viewing security warnings during API testing

When you [send a request](/docs/sending-requests/requests/), Postman scans it for potential security risks.

If it detects any, Postman notifies you using a dot on the security overview icon <img alt="Security overview icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-lock.jpg#icon" width="11px"> in the right sidebar.

1. Select the icon to view the warnings.
1. For more details, select a warning to expand it.
1. Select **Possible fix** to learn about possible ways to fix the underlying problem.

## Security linting with the Postman CLI

> [The Postman CLI is only available to Postman Enterprise teams.](https://www.postman.com/pricing)

You can set your API Security rules to run during your CI/CD builds using the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/). On the Postman CLI configuration page, select **Run security rules**. This will generate the correct Postman CLI command, which you can copy and paste in the command line. To see the results, go to the build page and select the desired build. Next, select the schema to expand it and see the buildâ€™s results and any rule violations, if applicable.
