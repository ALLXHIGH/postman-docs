> [Configurable governance rules are only available to Postman Enterprise teams.](https://www.postman.com/pricing) If you don't have an Enterprise account, you'll be able to see the API governance admin panel, but you won't be able to turn rules on or off or add new rules.

The _API governance admin panel_ enables you to customize the governance rules that Postman applies to your API at the design phase. Postman applies governance rules to your [API definition](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/defining-an-api/) and shows warnings about your definition to help you keep your API consistent and consumable.
