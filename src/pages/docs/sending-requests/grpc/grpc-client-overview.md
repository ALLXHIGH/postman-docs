_gRPC_ is a schema-driven Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework often used to enable inter-service communication. Being RPC-based, it facilitates client-server communication over a function call instead of an HTTP call. gRPC has gained significant popularity because of its easier abstraction than HTTP, support across multiple languages, and high performance.

gRPC uses [Protocol Buffers (protobuf)](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) as the Interface Definition Language (IDL) to define the API interface (service definition) which serves as a contract between the client and the server specifying the supported services and methods.

## Developing gRPC APIs with Postman

Postman has a client interface to work with gRPC services and the API Builder interface to create and manage your protobuf definitions. Using a gRPC request, you can view supported services and methods (with a service definition), invoke the method of your interest, send a message payload, and view the response from the server, all without entering commands in the terminal or writing any code. You can save these requests into a collection to reuse them later, share them with your teammates, or publish them to the community on [Postman's public API network](/docs/getting-started/exploring-public-api-network/).

You can use the [Postman API Builder](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/the-api-workflow/) to create the service definition using protobuf IDL and maintain it as a single source of truth for your API project.
