You can save, edit, and create example responses for gRPC requests. These [saved examples](/docs/sending-requests/examples/) can help consumers understand, document, and mock what responses will look like even before the API is up and running. gRPC saved examples are basically a blank canvas where you can create responses for any use case.

## Saving an example gRPC response

This example will create and execute a server streaming request, then save the response as an example.

> If you are using the Postman web app, Postman recommends using the Postman Desktop Agent for the best experience. See [About the Postman Agent](/docs/getting-started/about-postman-agent/) for more information.

1. In Postman, select  **New > gRPC Request** to open a request in a new tab.

1. Select **Server URL** and enter `grpc.postman-echo.com`.

1. Select the **Select a method** dropdown and select **LotsOfGreetings**.

1. Select **Generate example message**. This creates a sample message using the service definition itself so that you donâ€™t have to set the correct fields and data types.

1. Replace the sample string data with your name (or any other string) and select **Invoke**. A single message appears in the response section and the connection status is **STREAMING**.

1. Select **End Streaming**. More messages appear in the response section, including the example message with your edited string.

1. Select **Save as Example**. The saved example opens in a new tab.
