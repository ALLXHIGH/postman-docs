The Postman app enables you to capture cookies from a browser or client application. You can capture cookies using either the Postman proxy or Postman Interceptor, without starting a [debug session](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/capture-overview/).

Once enabled, Postman continuously captures cookies for the domains you specify. Captured cookies are automatically synced to your Postman cookie jar. You can then use the cookies when sending requests from Postman. Learn more about [using cookies](/docs/sending-requests/cookies/).

> Capturing cookies is only available using the [Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation-and-updates/#web-limitations).

> You can also capture requests and cookies during a proxy or Interceptor debug session. Learn more about capturing requests with [Postman proxy](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/capturing-http-requests/) or [Postman Interceptor](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/interceptor/).
