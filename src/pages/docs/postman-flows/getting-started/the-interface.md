## Toolbar

The toolbar gives you access to tools you can use to manipulate the canvas.

- **Zoom controls**

  Use the toolbar to zoom in or out the canvas. Fit-to-view adjusts the zoom level to fit your entire Flow on the visible canvas.

  You can also hold down `ctrl`/`cmd` scroll to zoom in or out
