Data moves through Postman Flows by passing from one block to another. This document describes how Postman Flows gets and handles data.

## Contents

## Getting data

Postman Flows gets data with [API requests](/docs/getting-started/sending-the-first-request/) from existing collections in your workspace. Postman Flows also accepts data pasted into the **Start** block.

### Getting data with an API request

Postman Flows can get data using a request from one of your existing collections by creating a **Send Request** block and selecting the request from the **Add request** field. If your collection includes a [saved response](/docs/sending-requests/responses/#saving-responses), the **Send Request** block will preload the response's structure so you can navigate to the data you want to use.

1. Create a collection called Random User Facts and add a GET request to `https://randomuser.me/api/`.
