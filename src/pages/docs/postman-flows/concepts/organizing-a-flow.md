When a flow is just a few blocks, it is pretty easy for the original creator to understand. Once flows become more then a few blocks and other people start working on them, it can quickly become difficult to understand what all the moving parts are doing. That's where tools like colors, annotations, and grouping comes in.

### Colors

You can configure every block in flows to be highlighted with one of the preset colors. This can make it easy to differentiate two of the same types of block that are doing different things right next to each other. You can add a color by selecting a block, the select the paint icon in the top-left corner that appears on the block.

### Annotations

When collaborating with other people or putting a flow in a public workspace, its helpful to add directions directly on the canvas. This helps explain how to use the flow and what certain blocks are doing. Select the **Add Text** button in the toolbar to add an annotations. Selecting some text in an annotation brings up the text formatting menu which that allows bold, italics, or heading options. If you copy a link, then highlight some text and paste the link, the highlighted text becomes a hyperlink.

### Grouping

Grouping allows any number of blocks and annotations to be grouped together. The group can then be named, given a color, resized, and have blocks added or removed from it. This can be useful in an instance where several blocks may be involved in performing a task such as sending an email.

You can access the grouping menu by either pressing down the Shift key and dragging the mouse cursor around a set of blocks, or holding the command (Mac) or control (Windows) key, then clicking the blocks you want to add. Selecting the file icon will create a group.
