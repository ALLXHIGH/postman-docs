When a flow is just a few blocks, it is pretty easy for the original creator to understand. Once flows become more then a few blocks and other people start working on them, it can quickly become difficult to understand what all the moving parts are doing. That's where tools like colors, annotations, and grouping comes in.

### Colors

Every block in flows can be configured to be highlighted with one of the preset colors. This can make it easy to differentiate two of the same types of block that are doing different things right next to eachother. A color can be added by clicking on a block, and clicking on the paint icon in the top-left corner that appears on the block.

### Annotations

When collaborating with other people, or putting a flow in a public workspace, its helpful to add directions directly on the canvas to explain how to use the flow and what certain blocks are doing. An annotation can be added by pressing the add text button the toolbar. Selecting some text in an annotation brings up the text formatting menu that allows bolding, italics, or heading options. If a link is copied, then some text is highlight and pasted, the highlighted text will become a hyperlink.

### Grouping

Grouping allows any number of blocks and annotations to be grouped together. This group can then be named, given a color, resized, and have blocks added or removed from it. This can be useful in an instance where serval blocks may be involved in performing a task such as sending an email. The grouping menu can be accessed by either holding down shift and dragging the mouse cursor around a set of blocks, or holding the command (Mac) or control (Windows) key, and then clicking the blocks to add. Pressing the icon that looks like a file will create a group.
